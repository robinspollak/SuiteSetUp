# SuiteSetUp
This is a web app to help students at Pomona College find their ideal living conditions. It provides various services
to a user including a means to explore available suites on campus (separated by area of campus, size, and dorm) and also
a matching functionality which takes into account past years room draw data to see which suites a group is likely to end up with
based on their room draw numbers.
